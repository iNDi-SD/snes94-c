/* The game logic, rewritten in C from the community's byte-matching disassembly of the cartridge
 * (NHL94SNES, github.com/abdulahmad/NHL94SNES): one C file per module of it (each file's first line
 * names its folder, src/routines/MODULE, one .asm file a routine), every routine under its label.
 *
 * Conventions. An object (the 65816's X, an object index: object * 2) is passed as its number o,
 * 0-15: g.facedir[o] is facedir,x. The direct page's scratch registers (r0-r9, p0, p1, a0-a5,
 * d0-d6, tmp0-tmp5) are the routine's parameters, results and locals, as C arguments, return
 * values and locals; a result left in the Z flag is an int, nonzero for Z set. */
