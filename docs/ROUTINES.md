# The routines

Every function in `game/`, by folder and file: the C name, the original routine it is (the
disassembly's label of the same name and its cartridge address), and what it does. Generated from
the code's own comments by `tools/routines.py`. A helper is a piece split out of an original
routine, a part a routine shares with others, or a small function of the C's own.

881 functions: 702 original routines, 179 helpers.

## Play: the game on the ice (the game loop, skating, the AI, checks, the puck, goalies, penalties, the shootout)

### `game/play/assign.c` (19)

| Function | Original | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `assfaceoff` | `$9FB26A` | Assignment $16: wait (unless locked in an animation) until the face off is over. |
| `assdopen` | `$9EBEDF` | Assignment $0E: sit player o in the penalty box (PBnum: $10 a home player, 1 a visitor). |
| `assfaceoffpl` | `$9FB27C` | Assignment $17: a player taking the face off. |
| `assstanley` | `$9EA69D` | Assignment 9, the Stanley Cup: skate to the side of the screen (x +-90, the scroll y) holding the cup, then face that way, locked 20 frames. |
| `check4bench` | `$9FDC4C` | When a line change wants player o off (and he caused no penalty): to the bench (assignment $0C, pf2unav) unless he is going there already or has the puck, or, for the same roster player, a new assignment from his new position. |
| `assnothing` | `$9E8BD7` | A computer player stands still (doplayeracc with no direction); a human is left alone. |
| `ass_start` | (a helper) | (assdefo / asswingd / assdefd's start, as asswingo's: on offense the carrier gets asspuckc ($11) on top and the other team's puck makes it assignment def, on defense his own team's does; the clock stopped: assnothing; check4bench; a human is left alone; the first time, the timers reset. |
| `ass_timer` | (a helper) | (temp1 -= d7; when it runs out, plus add, at least 0; nonzero then) |
| `assdefo` | `$9E8804` | Assignment 1: a defenseman on offense holds the blue line on his side (x +-80, at the puck x when it is on his side, halfway otherwise; y by the puck's zone, 98 when offside), avoiding the carrier. |
| `asswingd` | `$9E8968` | Assignment 3: a wing on defense covers his side (x +-100, at the puck x when it is on his side), at a y following the puck between his blue line and goal line (the limit when the carrier is a goalie or his team is offside). |
| `assdefd` | `$9E8618` | Assignment 2: a defenseman on defense: when his timer runs out, a spot (x +-65, 0 when the puck is on the other side) 40 behind the furthest attacker (led by his velocity toward the goal; at most 220 out); skates there, then looks for a check. |
| `bench_pos` | (a helper) | (assbench's .8: the new position (newpos) and its assignment; the requests cleared) |
| `assbench` | `$9FD85F` | Assignment $0C: the player skates to the bench door (x -144, y -80 home / +80 visitors) unless check4bench ends it (or he caused a penalty: out); there he glides into the wall and is locked (temp1 = 100); then his slot goes to the bench and the new player comes on (setplayer). |
| `asseben` | `$9FD9E1` | Assignment $0A: coming on from the bench: first at the door (x -136, y 14 per slot from his object number), locked in the wall animation; when it is over he faces right and skates out ($1000), the assignment over. |
| `assscore` | `$9EB0B8` | Assignment 8: celebrating a goal (bench a2 + 2 cheers when gmode $40): unless a human holds a button, player a3 (from the slow-down on: o and a3 are the same player in the game) slows to 3/4, drops the puck (a carrier test that compares his number with puckc's index), skates to the side of the screen and celebrates there now and then (the scorer pumps his arm). |
| `pad_back` | (a helper) | (asspenalty / assepen: from team a2's padsitnext on, round robin, the next pad moved off it for a penalty (high byte set) whose team is a2; it goes back to the team (padside, cont1team); the original loops for ever when there is none) |
| `pen_pads` | (a helper) | (asspenalty's .9: with 4 pads or more on team a2 and as many skaters left or fewer, a pad sits out (from padsitnext on; with 3 skaters first one comes back): its player loses it; then player o, still with a pad, passes it to a teammate) |
| `assepen` | `$9EBADA` | Assignment $0B: player o (of team a2) leaves the penalty box. |
| `asspenalty` | `$9EBCC7` | Assignment $0D: player o (team a2) skates to the penalty box. |

### `game/play/checks.c` (78)

| Function | Original | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `vtoa` | `$9BB445` | The direction (0-7, 8 = none) of the vector dx / dy: its signs and two slope tests (each side against twice the other, unsigned as the 65816 compares) pick it from the cartridge's table. |
| `SetSPA` | `$9EA3DD` | Start animation anim on object o (the same one keeps going). |
| `chkpk` | `$9E8272` | Z: player o is killing a penalty (no power play: never). |
| `chkpk2` | `$9E827C` | Z: player o is on the team a man short (sf2pwrtm is 0 for team 1). |
| `assexit` | `$9E8BE6` | End player o's assignment and go back to the one under it. |
| `assinsert` | `$9E8C0E` | Give player o assignment ass on top of the current one. |
| `assreplace` | `$9E8C18` | Overwrite player o's current assignment with ass. |
| `GetHot` | `$9BC002` | The hot spot of object o's sprite frame: the frame record's signed bytes at +$12 / +$13, x negated when the frame is flipped (attribute $0800), y unless it is flipped vertically ($1000); on the horizontal screen turned a quarter, (x, y) -> (y, -x). |
| `AdjustFacingDirection` | `$9EDC06` | Turn goalie o's facing a step the short way toward want, at most a step per 6 ticks. |
| `playeracc` | `$9EA719` | Player g.curobj accelerates toward direction dir, up to his top speed: a step of the direction (none into the wall he last hit), scaled by weight and leg strength and the frames elapsed (d7), added to his velocity unless his speed would pass the limit for his leg speed and energy; then, with line changes on, one call in 64 wears his energy down. |
| `revplayeracc` | `$9EAB64` | Flip direction dir when player o skates backwards, then accelerate toward it. |
| `skatetopuckinit` | `$9EDEA7` | Where the puck will be soon: its position plus half the high byte of its velocity. |
| `PuckIChk` | `$9EF751` | Icing: once armed and not yet called, the loose puck past the far goal line calls it. |
| `CompShoot` | `$9EE10B` | Computer player o shoots: the swing time temp2b is the distance to the goal line / 8, at most 20, and the assignment becomes assshoot ($13). |
| `puckshadow` | `$9EEF34` | The puck shadow (object o) follows the puck, one unit off it, while the puck frame shows. |
| `EvadePC` | `$9E8904` | A skateto callback: when the puck carrier will be within 40 of player o next frame on both axes, the direction away from him; otherwise direction d0 as it was. |
| `StopNA` | `$9EA539` | Slow player o down without changing his animation: a human goalie (not carrying the puck) loses half his speed, everybody else ($70 + legstr) * timestep per axis, down to zero. |
| `avd_zones` | (a helper) | (.27 for a skater, .48 for a goalie: lim is $2C or $24) |
| `avd_skater` | (a helper) | (the skater's cases: .t2x when tmp1 = 0, else the table .26 by tmp0) |
| `avd_goalie` | (a helper) | (the goalie's cases: .t3 when tmp1 = 0, else the table .47 by tmp0) |
| `avd_mirror` | (a helper) | (a path crossing the top goal: mirrored onto the bottom one) |
| `avdgoal` | `$9EAB74` | Keep player o from skating through a goal: when the path to d0 / d1 crosses a net, aim beside it (the goalie keeps to his crease's sides). |
| `ClearOffsidesIfAllPlayers` | `$9EF8C4` | Clear team a2's offsides flag once none of its six skaters is past the blue line (y beyond $58 from his own goal). |
| `chk4shot` | `$9EDED4` | A computer player with the puck looks for a shot: in the last seconds with the clock running he shoots; with nothing special on, a threat and 1 in 4 he dumps the puck in; otherwise a random roll on his shot odds (better near the goal, worse with the goalie set, an opponent in the way doubling them) decides, when he is in front of the goal line. |
| `goalieacc` | `$9ECFDC` | Goalie o skates in direction d0 (8: none, 9: stop), turning a step at a time toward it near his goal or with the puck, or slows down. |
| `puckflip` | `$9EDE5E` | Spin the puck: its facing flipped by bit 0 of d0, its flip animation started. |
| `check4check` | `$9EA164` | A chance to check: on 2 random rolls against (20 - checking) * 2 (with penalties on), an opponent within 34 straight ahead of player o, not already holding / locked, is hooked or held (Acheck) or burst into (burst, by player a3), by where o is and 7 in 8 of the random bits. |
| `findpc` | `$9FCBB6` | Choose the player for pad d4 (X = o, a3 the player again after the search): when o is a free skater close to the puck, or the pad's best skater (distance to the puck, plus a penalty for the puck's direction against the one preferred from o's goal, the two XORed) has it already, o starts a sweep check unless locked; else the best one takes the pad. |
| `dostop` | `$9EA4F7` | Player o stops: a fast one (over $1000 on an axis) glides (backwards) or plays the stop (the puck carrier with the skate stop sound $11), then slows down (StopNA). |
| `noturn0` | `$9EAAB3` | Player o's wanted direction needs no turn (d0 = wanted - facing, * 2; d2 the direction to skate): facing it he skates (backwards, stumbling injured, with the puck), otherwise he stops when moving within 90 degrees of it, else turns a step and glides. |
| `doplayeracc` | `$9EA8A9` | Player o skates toward direction d0 (low nibble: 0-7, 8 none, 9 stop): goalies by goalieacc; skaters decide on skating backwards (in their own half, the puck ahead, or staying so), then turn toward it at a rate falling with speed, or need no turn (noturn0), and accelerate. |
| `skate_avoid` | (a helper) | (skateto's avoidance routine, a0: run through the RAM trampoline jmlvector, which is set) |
| `skateto` | `$9EA5A4` | Player o skates toward d0 / d1 (around the goals, led by his velocity), every $0C frames aiming again; slowing down to a stop (direction 9) near it (within 5, or 12 when fast; goalies only with goalieflags bit 1; the distance measured from the target plus the velocity's sides as ApproxLength left them, not the lead); the avoidance routine a0 may change the direction; standing with no direction he looks at the puck (that direction is not used). |
| `skatetopuck` | `$9EAFB5` | Player o skates to where the puck will be (around the goals, led by his hot spot and velocity), aiming again every 5 frames; a skater facing the puck (head on to its travel) at the right range from its carrier sweep checks instead (as player a3, who then also skates). |
| `off_spot` | (a helper) | (asswingo / asscentero: a new spot from the table row d2 (x, x spread, y, y spread) in temp3 temp4, unless the row is the same as last time and the random word is not small) |
| `off_zone` | (a helper) | (asswingo / asscentero: d2 = the zone of puck y d0 (lead d3) seen from the player's goal: 0 back, 8 mid, 16 past the blue line (unless offside), 24 past the goal line) |
| `ass_start` | (a helper) | (asswingo / asscentero / asscenterd's start: on offense the carrier gets asspuckc ($11) on top and the other team's puck makes it assignment def, on defense his own team's does; the clock stopped: assnothing; then check4bench; a human is left alone; the first time, the timers (and with spots the last spot row) reset. |
| `ass_timer` | (a helper) | (temp1 -= d7; nonzero when it ran out: then reloaded with add, at least 0) |
| `asswingo` | `$9E8A6A` | Assignment 4: a wing on offense skates (avoiding the carrier) to a spot of the puck's zone (puck y led by its velocity), picked again as the zone changes or at random when his timer runs out. |
| `asscentero` | `$9E843C` | Assignment 6: the center on offense, the same with his own spots (CenterOSpots) by the puck y. |
| `asscenterd` | `$9E8573` | Assignment 5: the center on defense, halfway between the puck and his goal. |
| `assgoalietopuck` | `$9ED179` | Assignment $12: the goalie skates out to a loose puck (goalieflags bits 1-2 by where he is), while his team is not near it and it does not come at his net fast; the leg strength doubled meanwhile. |
| `ChkOffsides` | `$9EF78A` | Offsides, both teams: each team's flag cleared once it is back onside (d0 as given for the first's empty spots); when the puck crosses a blue line ($54 from centre) StartBreakaway, and with offsides on the team attacking that end (by the carrier, or the last player to touch it) is flagged when one of its skaters is past the line ($5E). |
| `ChkOffsides_other` | `$9EF833` | ChkOffsides with the puck in the bottom half: the line d0 negated (the skaters' line $0A below d0 as CheckBreakaway leaves it), the teams a1 / a2 swapped the other way. |
| `checkob` | `$9EC417` | The little offsides referee: with offsides on, while a teammate of player o is past the blue line ($5C) with the puck outside it, sflags bit 15 is set and the ref shown (PushRef 6, when no ref is up); once none is, the flag cleared and the ref erased (unless a ref window is up). |
| `chk4pass` | `$9EE89F` | A computer player o with the puck looks for a pass (1 in 2 or so without a threat): a random teammate, available, ahead of him or not too far back (and on his side of the blue line with offsides on), with no opponent closer to the puck in that direction. |
| `assshoot` | `$9EE146` | Assignment $13: a computer shot: the first time it starts (SetShotMode); with shot mode over, the assignment is over; meanwhile the swing timer temp2b counts down, releasing the shot button (d2 cbut) when it runs out (ShotMode, the pad direction from temp1). |
| `a2offsides` | `$9EC5F0` | Offsides on player a2 (a3 his partner in a2 / a3, swapped around the call as the original does): with offsides on, the puck past the blue line in his attacking zone and his team flagged. |
| `a2touchpuck` | `$9EC4F3` | Player a2 touches the puck: the last toucher (ltx / lty / ltplayer) and his team's last three touches (a new touch after the team's flag 4 raises the home crowd), then offsides; a called icing (by the player iflags names, X = x around it) unless the touching team may touch it; otherwise icing re-armed for him when the puck is in his half and his team is not short-handed. |
| `asspassrec` | `$9EE706` | Assignment $15: waiting for a pass. |
| `sopath_next` | (a helper) | (assbreakaway's .9: the next point of the path (x signed by its side), the distance for the one after) |
| `sopath_start` | (a helper) | (assbreakaway's .11 / .4x: the side to go in on, at random or by his stick hand, signed by his goal; close in (d0, his distance from his own end, past $2C) the path starts at its third point, straight in when he is near the middle. |
| `assbreakaway` | `$9EE463` | Assignment $10: a computer puck carrier on a breakaway skates the path to the net (no avoidance) and, once his facing turns from the path's (at random), shoots a one-timer at the goal's side; with the clock stopped he glides back. |
| `fo_find` | (a helper) | (Endfaceoff's .13: the player of team y0's six in position p, -1 for none) |
| `Endfaceoff` | `$9FB092` | Drop the puck (a3, the puck object): the face off sound, the face off over and the clock going; the winner picked at random by the two centres' pulls (fofdata2), the puck sent in his pad direction (fodir1 / fodir2) or at random toward his side (and then 1 in 4 at random anyway); the centre of the team it goes to touches it (a2touchpuck); the puck takes assignment $18. |
| `assnearest` | `$9E800D` | Assignment 1: the player nearest the puck who does not have it (a goalie: assgoalie; the computer carrier: asspuckc on top). |
| `CompLine` | `$9FDA53` | The computer picks team a2's line (a1 the other team): with a man more or less, of lines 3 / 4 (short) or 5 / 6 (the power play), the one with more energy; at even strength (the home team with a human on pad 1 and automatic changes, or the visitors: the second table) the first line of a list (by the score in the third period) with energy left, the home team's matching the other team's line when it has enough. |
| `CPgoalie` | `$9ED130` | The computer pulls team a2's goalie (a1 the other team) in the third period, behind by one or two with under a minute ($3D) left and the puck (y d1) in its attacking half: tmgoalie's high byte $FF, then setpersonel. |
| `return_goalie` | (a helper) | (ReturnGoalies' .1: team a2's pulled goalie back, unless a pad is on the team: then CPgoalie with the faceoff spot's y) |
| `ReturnGoalies` | `$9ED0FD` | At a faceoff each team's pulled goalie comes back (for a computer team, unless CPgoalie pulls him again). |
| `chk_goalie` | (a helper) | (ChkGoalies' .1: team a2 with the puck pulls its goalie on a delayed penalty, or a computer team by CPgoalie) |
| `ChkGoalies` | `$9ED0A8` | With the clock running, each team may pull its goalie (chk_goalie). |
| `puck_cross` | (a helper) | (pucknorm_move's .16: where and in how many frames the puck crosses the goal line d4 (the entry at y of puckcross: x clamped to the sidelines, frames; $FFFF frames when it moves away or not at all); returns d0 as left) |
| `pucknorm_move` | `$9EDCC3` | The puck (x) moves: the goal-line crossing times run down, and every 5 frames they are worked out again (puck_cross); a carried puck is touched and follows his stick (a quarter of the way to his hot spot, his velocity); icing and offsides; with the clock running, during a penalty shot a puck going back toward the shooter's end for $30 frames ends it, and a puck that has not moved for $78 frames is out of play (PenOOP); a puck at rest on the ice stops spinning; then its collisions (checkpuckcoll). |
| `pucknorm` | `$9EDCA8` | Assignment $18 (the puck most of the time): the first time, its timers reset (still puck $78, the penalty shot's count back); then pucknorm_move. |
| `chk4lc` | `$9FDBD0` | A computer carrier o (a3 after setpersonel) in his own end ($58 from his goal) changes lines on 1 in 4 (line changes on, not automatic; no change under way, his line tired: under $C01, no penalty shot): CompLine, setpersonel, the scoreboard, then he shoots the puck in (CompShoot: returns nonzero, his caller is ended too). |
| `asspuckc_chkdir` | (a helper) | (asspuckc's .chkdir, a skateto callback: when an opponent (led by his velocity) will be within $15 of where the puck goes (threat counted), the direction away from him, turned a step at random when that is right behind player o; otherwise d0's low byte as it was) |
| `asspuckc` | `$9E8292` | Assignment $11: the puck carrier (anyone else, or a human, leaves it). |
| `updatefaceoff` | `$9FAF1E` | The puck drop of player o's faceoff (temp1 the timer): while it runs, the drop frame 10 - (timer + 6) / 8 into fofdata in its last steps; when it is over the faceoff box is erased (its print position by fodropx / fodropy; the penalty shot's own box) and the frame counts restart. |
| `fo_spot` | (a helper) | (puckfaceoff2: a player's faceoff spot, d1 his position: from the table .19 (by how many his team has on the ice; the penalty shot's .20) into the offsets .21, his end's way round; the skaters' near the faceoff spot pulled toward the middle) |
| `pads_off` | (a helper) | (puckfaceoff2: every pad of team t but the one kept (keep) moved off it) |
| `puckfaceoff2` | `$9FA835` | Assignment $17 (the puck at a faceoff), object o, a3 the puck object. |

| `fo_pad_line` | (a helper) | (puckfaceoff's .5 / .6: automatic changes: the computer's line for team a2; else player p (an object * 2) opens his team's box, and when it is open its timer (home temp1 / temp3 of the puck a3 $258, visitors temp2 / temp4 $168) starts with him as its owner) |
| `fo_pad_player` | (a helper) | (puckfaceoff's .10-.12: the player of the first pad of team a2 (c1playernum by padside)) |
| `fo_box_timer` | (a helper) | (puckfaceoff's .t1xxxxxxx: the line change box timer of the puck a3 at d0 (0: temp1 / temp3 for the home team, $20: temp2 / temp4 for the visitors): its owner's box closed meanwhile: the timer stopped and the box drawn again; run out: the box still open makes his choice row 0 (lcfound) and draws it again) |
| `puckfaceoff` | `$9FB355` | Assignment $1C (the puck before a faceoff), object o, a3 the puck object (d0 and a0 as the caller left them, for pucknorm_move). |

### `game/play/collide.c` (45)

| Function | Original | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `getpde` | `$9FDCB2` | The energy of player o (getpde leaves the team, nonzero for the visitors, in a2 and the player number * 2 in d1: setpde's arguments) |

| `makepde` | `$9FDCEB` | Rating a scaled by the energy of player o (a0) (product / $1000); the carry is left clear. |
| `checkagr` | `$9EC124` | Player o's penalty roll: random below (20 - aggress) * 16, doubled on a pad, halved within 40 of the puck. |
| `TryAddPlayerToList` | `$9FD6D8` | Roster player d0 of team a2 into slot d4 of the list at a4 if he is available (on the ice, on the bench or not yet there, and not in the list): returns him (Z clear), or 0 (*d1 = 0). |
| `rb` | (a helper) | (ResetBench for team a0 = 0 / 2 with box count unit d1: every player counted, and taken off again when on the ice or the bench (who goes to the bench) or injured with no time left) |
| `ResetBench` | `$9FCDAC` | Empty the penalty boxes and put every player on his own bench. |
| `deflect` | `$9EF722` | The puck is deflected: loose, a random velocity (x, y within +-$1000, height up to $FFF), spun. |
| `sp_adj` | (a helper) | (setplayer's .8: rating a plus the player's hot / cold byte for stat k (/ 4), 0-15, in 8 bits) |
| `setplayer` | `$9FCEF6` | Bring roster player d3 onto the ice as object o: off the injured list, out of the box (assignment $0B) or off the bench ($0A), on the ice; his 12 ratings from his roster record with the power play, penalty kill, home / visitor and late third period bonuses (none for a goalie) and his hot cold bytes. |
| `forcepldata` | `$9FCE1D` | At a face off: team a2's six players take their new positions (newpos, a byte) straight away, with their assignments (and a centre the face off one, $12), and their new roster players (newpnum) on the ice. |
| `setInjuryType` | `$9EC2D0` | Player a2 is injured: pf2inj, the crowd louder (held 60 frames) and groaning (stream 4), the screen locked on him, his roster slot out of the game (1 in 8 rosterNone, TempPlOffset bit $4000), who it is in TempPlOffset. |
| `wallcoll` | `$9E8F42` | Object o bounces off a wall of angle cos / sin (kept in Wallcos / Wallsin): its velocity split into v1n (into the wall) and v1t (along it), each cut, rotated back into a3's velocity. |
| `wallcollb_out` | `$9E8F05` | The puck is out of play: the screen locked, the puck out of collisions (pfnc = $40), flipped at the bottom end, its shadow gone; with the clock running the last toucher's shootout result (ShootoutWonBy 6); a penalty shot over. |
| `wallcollb` | `$9E8E91` | Object o hits a wall (cos / sin, a3 for the bounce): a high puck, or a fast one rising into the net's top behind the goal, goes over the glass (the shadow's glass animation, stream 6, the crowd) and out of play; anything else bounces. |
| `clamp_ff` | (a helper) | (checkgoalp: a cosine / sine of the bounce off the goal kept to -$FF .. |
| `checkgoalp` | `$9E92F8` | Player o (a3 from the first test on) runs into goal a2 at d2 / d3 (wcradius around it): close to its back he bounces off it (wallcoll, the angle from the goal's centre). |

| `checkwallcoll` | `$9E8D3E` | Object o at d2 / d3 against the rink: in an end zone's corner circle (64 in from the boards, by its radius) a bounce off the curve (wallcollb, the normal from the circle's centre); between the corners at the ends the goals (checkgoal); then, when nothing hit, the straight boards. |
| `puckglue` | `$9E9A49` | Player a2 takes the puck (a new carrier: the puck sound 3, a penalty shot over): the other team's touches cleared (flag 4), a face off won counted (the crowd), a completed pass counted; a goalie catching it makes a save (ChkShotStat) and holds it (temp5 140, 5 after a dive); the pass receiver's pad goes to him, or the next pad of his team (PuckCarrierPad). |
| `SetPlList` | `$9FD55D` | The list of the players team a2 wants on the ice now (PlList: six roster numbers, then the six positions they take): from its current line in priolist's order for the men it has (a penalty shot: the shooter and the goalie; no goalie when he is pulled), each one not available replaced by the first available of his position's substitutes (sublist; $80: anyone, from the last roster player down). |
| `setpersonel` | `$9FD407` | Put team a2's wanted players (SetPlList) on the ice: the newpos / newpnum requests of its six objects cleared, then a wanted player already on the ice keeps his object, and each other one takes a free object (the last free one found, one in play preferred). |
| `excite` | (a helper) | Raise the crowd's excitement CwdExciteLvl by n (a hit, a fall), unless it would go negative |
| `FallDown` | `$9E9B52` | Player y (a2) falls or stumbles from a hit by x (a3 the hitter after it; the team check counted for x): near the boards he goes into them (by where he is and where the hit came from, put against the boards or the corner's curve), by the bench over it; otherwise he falls back (hit from the front), forward or flips (a strong checker); a skater with the puck stick-handling well and no lockout only stumbles. |
| `check_int` | (a helper) | (checkint's .ci: goalie a2 against player x (a3): with the clock running and x's impact past 26 (past 3 when a3 has the puck), x falls (FallDown by the goalie); a hard hit on the goalie (past 31) may be interference on x (by his aggression), unless he is out of his crease) |
| `checkint` | `$9EBA4F` | A goalie and another player collide (x and a2 / a3 each way: check_int): the skater falls, and interference may be called. |
| `penshot_foul` | (a helper) | (a foul on player a2 when he is the carrier on a breakaway and no shooter is set: a penalty shot (on x) for him; nonzero then) |
| `Bcheck` | `$9EBC24` | Player a2, sweep checking, body checks x (a3): unless x is locked or a goalie (or, with penalties off, a human checker loses a roll on checking against x's legs), when x is in front of him a3 falls (FallDown by a2), then a penalty shot or (by aggression) tripping; collflag set. |
| `holdcheck` | `$9EA2F1` | Player a2 holds or hooks x (a3), who is in front of him: a2 turns to him, both take half their summed velocity, x flails (pfalock) and a2 holds (SPAHold2, or hooks), each the other's impactp; the carrier's shot is off; then a penalty shot or (by aggression) holding / hooking; collflag set. |
| `check_check` | (a helper) | (checkcheck's .cc: x checking a2: a2 holding or hooking is holdcheck, sweep checking Bcheck; otherwise x bursting into a2 plays a check by the direction (from the table .4, a shoulder or hip check, or at random the next one), and a skater a2 hit hard enough (d4, the impact, past $20) goes down on a roll against x's checking, with charging, roughing or a penalty shot by x's aggression; returns d4 as left) |
| `checkcheck` | `$9E9FF9` | Two players in contact: what happens each way (check_check of a3 on a2, then of a2 on a3). |
| `pl_pair` | (a helper) | (checkplcoll's .t3: players x (a3) and y touch (within $10) while closing in: any hold between them or their partners is broken; opponents take the impact (the closing speed / 16, at least 5, half again in a sweep check; the collision sound when hard with the carrier), then checkint and checkcheck; unless that set collflag, they bounce apart by their weights (+$8C), collflag set) |
| `pl_near` | (a helper) | (checkplcoll: object z of OOlist can touch x, at new x d2: in play, within 15 in x, no flag 15 pfnc, a player) |
| `checkplcoll` | `$9E9484` | Player x (a3) at his new place d2 / d3 against the players near him in y (OOlist, up then down, within $0E): pl_pair. |
| `checkcoll` | `$9E8C35` | Object x moves to d2 / d3 (swapped on the horizontal screen): the walls (at its hot spot, and a player's stick end too when the body hits none) and the players (checkplcoll), unless it skips collisions; after a player collision it goes back to its old place (but into the boards); otherwise it moves along OOlist (kept in y order) and its Ylist y is the new one. |
| `checkpuckcoll` | `$9E9788` | The puck (x, low: under $10) against the objects near it in y (OOlist, up then down, within $28): checkpuckcoll_ccx for each (a0 as the caller left it, for puckstick). |
| `puckbody` | `$9EEF7F` | The puck x hits player a2's body (d0 the squared distance from ccx): unless it is low and off by $10's remainder, he touches it with the puck sound 8 (the original compares a2touchpuck's A, never $E or more, where it meant the puck's height), the puck takes his offset (or his hot spot) as its velocity's high bytes and flips; a fast high puck (speed squared $0900 0000 or more, $C up) knocks him down (FallDown by a3), a slower one is caught. |
| `puckstick` | `$9EF5DA` | The puck x hits player a2's stick (d0 the squared distance, a0 the carrier as the original has it: what a2touchpuck left there, the carrier's team offset; read as the original leaves it, as an earlier puckstick of the same checkpuckcoll may have changed it). |
| `puckgoalie` | `$9EF042` | The puck x hits goalie a2 (d0 / d1 its offset from ccx): the save rating of the side it comes at (low: glove or stick, by his facing; high: the other two), unless he is diving and it is high; then the shot counts, he touches it (the sound, the crowd for a hard one); a carrier loses it. |
| `SetupPenaltyShot` | `$9FAFBE` | Set up a penalty shot: the puck at centre ice and still; each skater of the shooting team (BA_Team) takes assignment $10 eight times over (puckc him meanwhile); with manual goalies the other team's pad takes its goalie; the shooting team's touches cleared, the crowd excited; the shooter (BA_Sktr_SCnum) has the puck (and the pad pspad); PenShotActive, penshotlive, the time limit pstimer 1000; the penalty buffer cleared. |

| `GoalieCount` | `$9ED300` | The number of goalies of team a2: the nibbles of its goalie odds word (byte-swapped) until the rest is zero. |
| `AssignPadPlayer` | `$9FCB68` | Pad d4 takes control of player d0: its old player is released (pfna set, his pad bit cleared, playerpad -1, a goalie's goalieflags cleared), the new one marked (pflags bit 3, playerpad). |
| `StartPenaltyShot` | `$9EC72D` | A penalty shot for shooter BA_Sktr_SCnum, unless one is pending: his team (BA_Team, its tmPenShots), one man each on the ice, the shooter's roster number; the faceoff spot saved and cleared. |
| `GoaliePuckVector` | `$9EDC44` | d0 / d1 = the vector from goalie o to the puck; when one of them is behind the goal line ($108) and the other in front, d1 = +-1 so he faces out. |
| `CalcPuckDistances` | `$9CA58C` | For each of the 16 objects (curobj each in turn): puckdist2 (about (dx^2 + dy^2) / 16 by the quarters' low bytes), puckdist (ApproxLength) and puckdir (vtoa) to the puck. |
| `DumpInTarget` | `$9EECF6` | assdumpin's target: dumpinplayer = o, dumpintarget and passdir from where he is. |
| `CheckBreakaway` | `$9EC64B` | IsBreakaway = 1 when the puck carrier, in the half he attacks, has no opposing skater between him and the goal. |
| `GetFrameHot` | `$9BC074` | d0 / d1 = the stick hot spot of object o's frame (its record's bytes $14 - $12 and $13 - $15), x negated when flipped, y unless flipped vertically, turned in horizontal mode. |
| `AssignPadIfFree` | `$9FCB5C` | AssignPadPlayer, when player d0 has no pad yet. |
| `GlideBack` | `$9E8000` | Glide backwards, unless player o's animation is locked. |
| `PuckCarrierPad` | `$9FCB16` | When player d0 has the puck and no pad: the next of his team's pads in turn (puckpadnext, from pad 4 down), if it has any, takes him. |
| `PadTakePosition` | `$9FCD69` | Pad d4 takes the player of its team in position d1, if he has no pad and is available (pflags $1000 clear); padinputdone counts it. |
| `PadTakeLeftDefense` | `$9FCD4D` | With defence control on for player o's team: pad d4 takes the defenceman on the left of the screen (LD shooting at the top goal, else RD). |
| `PadTakeRightDefense` | `$9FCD2F` | The same for the defenceman on the right. |
| `PassPadToTeammate` | `$9FCD0A` | Pad d4 of penalized player o goes to the first teammate on the ice with no pad (the search does not stop before one is found). |
| `fp_side` | (a helper) | (FaceoffPads: a pad of the team (padside low byte side) whose side was moved off ($80xx) comes back when the team has fewer pads on its side than skaters on the ice, counted against the home team's pads (for both teams), from padsitnext on) |
| `fp_pads` | (a helper) | (FaceoffPads: each pad of the team in turn from the one after fopadfirst gets a player (findpc, run with the pad's index as the player); fopadfirst = the first) |
| `FaceoffPads` | `$9FC988` | At a faceoff: the distances to the puck, the pads moved for a penalty shot back on their sides, pads given back to a team short of them, the pad and goalie tables reset and every pad given a player again (findpc, a3 as given). |
| `dumpin_lob` | (a helper) | (assdumpin's lob: aimed at the target's spot spread at random (more for a worse passer), its speed from the distance (at least $10, a goalie $20, at most $60), lifted and spun; the carrier (g.curobj) lets go of it and swings) |
| `assdumpin` | `$9EED8D` | Assignment $14: the puck carrier o dumps the puck in: once the target is picked a computer player shoots instead toward $14 / 8 (CompShoot: returns nonzero, his caller ended too); he turns toward passdir (a goalie moves the target by the step he still has to turn) and lobs it. |
| `StartBreakaway` | `$9EC6E7` | At the blue line: CheckBreakaway; a new breakaway queues sound 5 (loudness $7000, not during a penalty shot), raises the crowd's excitement by 20 (unless that turns it negative) and counts for the carrier's team. |
| `EndPenaltyShot` | `$9EC791` | End the penalty shot or shootout attempt under way: no shooter, ShootoutWonBy 10, the faceoff spot saved at its start back as the last touch. |
| `div32u_carry` | (a helper) | (Div32S's carry, which assgoalie adds in after it: by the divide's path; the long loops leave bit 0 of r0 as it was, the 8-bit one bit 8, the hardware divider the carry it came with) |
| `div32s_carry` | (a helper) | (assgoalie: the carry Div32S leaves for n / d; a negative divisor or dividend is turned positive first, and a quotient of 0 from that gives 1) |
| `ag_clamp` | (a helper) | (assgoalie's .49: a goalie between the goal lines clamps the aim's y to the crease ($FEFD-$103; x 0 with the puck); then y made relative to the goal line d3) |
| `assgoalie` | `$9ED331` | Assignment 0: the goalie. |

| `ChkShotStat` | `$9EF213` | If a shot was taken (sflags $1000, with the clock running), count it: team shots (by the shooter's team), power play / shorthanded shots and shots by period (by his side: objects 6 and up are the visitors), the shooter's shots (but a goalie number) and the other goalie's shots against; then excite the crowd |

| `SetScore` | `$9F9EB7` | Play one period of playoff game a0 / 2 with random goals; after period 3 a game within a goal goes to overtime (period 3 again, flag 2), or in period 4 a tie goes to team 1 |
| `prefmes` | `$9EC160` | Print the message for penalty d0 (negative: only clear it): on the vertical rink in a frame sized to it, on the horizontal one in the message area. |
| `UpdateScores` | `$9F9712` | Update the other playoff games of the round: the ticker starts at the last; every game but the user's loses its highlight flag (2) and, unless over (4), plays a period (SetScore) |

| `checkfornewpen` | `$9EB1E5` | Go through PenBuf's new calls (not on the horizontal rink): a penalty that stops play does so (Stop4Pen) unless its team's opponent has the puck (a delayed call: the referee's arm, once); once seen (bit 7 of its player byte) a call sets the fight count down from its record |
| `UpdatePA` | `$9EF913` | The referee animation's next step when its count runs out; when the message time runs out, the message line cleared and the penalized player's name printed there, centred |

| `InProgress` | (a helper) | The referee's work on the last PenBuf entry (a0 just past the first one): a call already seen stays unless its player has left the ice; a new one (bit 15) sends its player to the box, starts a penalty shot or only shows its message (the stars first for the end of the game). |

| `piece_entry` | (a helper) | (one OAM entry for the current piece at (px, py), if on screen: the tile word (piece tile + first tile, xor r3) and the high table's size and X bits; mode: 0 plain, 1 mirrored, 2 flipped (x mirrored too when r3 has $4000)) |
| `draw_pieces` | (a helper) | (DrawSprite_draw's piece loop: an OAM entry for each of the r0 pieces of the frame at [p0], 7 bytes each from +$16 (X, Y, tile, size), while sprites are left) |
| `DrawSprite_draw` | `$80B0B0` | Draw the frame at [p0] at (r5, r5h), r3 xored into each tile word (bit 15: flipped, the pieces' positions mirrored, DrawSpritePieces; bit 14: mirrored); x is the original's X at the tile cache lookup |
| `DrawSprite` | `$80B08D` | Draw frame `frame` of the sprite set at [p1] (p1 the direct page's 4 bytes) at (x, y), a xored into the tile and attribute word |

| `FreeCacheEntry_go` | `$80B77B` | Free tile cache entry x: the last entry moves into its slot (its frame pointed at it), and its VRAM run is given back, joined with a free run after it (blocks: in the same row of 8) and with a free run before it |
| `FreeCacheEntry` | `$80B772` | Free entry x of frame number y (its FrameCacheOf slot cleared); _A: the entry in a's high byte |
| `FreeFrameTiles` | `$80B719` | Free the VRAM tiles of the frame at [p0] (by its number with FrameByNumber); not cached: nothing. |
| `FreeFrameTiles_freeframe` | `$80B724` | (unused entries) FreeFrameTiles for frame a of the sprite set at [p1]; the sum of the free block run lengths, walking from index SpriteBlockTiles |
| `FreeCacheEntry_go_countfree` | `$80B8AE` | (unused entry) The sum of the free block run lengths, walking BlockRuns from SpriteBlockTiles (after a free run the step is the sum so far, as the original) |
| `SpriteFrameStart` | `$80AF7B` | Start filling OAMDrawBuf after the reserved entries (the high table's shift from the byte offset, as the original); age the tile cache's use marks and free the entries not drawn since |
| `DMAToCGRAM` | `$808723` | DMA x colours from [p0] to CGRAM at colour y: at once with the screen blanked (none for x = 0; y is a byte there, CGADD), else left for the NMI (CGDMALen etc.; the colour word as y is) |
| `DMAToCGRAM_t3` | `$808766` | (unused entry) x colours from colour y of [p0] into [p1]: a = 0 fills them with y * 2 (the index, as the original leaves it in A), $0100 copies them, else scales each component by the byte a / 256 (the multiplier) |
| `PulseColour` | `$9D96A9` | Store at y:x the colour of this moment (vcount) of a 60-frame pulse: white to $7E10 and back, each component interpolated over 30 frames (the divides' remainders as the divider leaves them) |

| `MapPartToVRAM` | `$808BED` | Copy a part of map [p0] (its width at +0): r4 entries by r4+2 rows from column r7, row r7+2, into the screen map at column x (32 or more: the next screen), row y; at once or queued as MapToVRAM |
| `MapPartToVRAMOffset` | `$808A11` | The same into VRAM through VMDATA with the screen blanked (it waits for that), adding a and ORing r3 into each entry |
| `PrintLetterSprites` | `$9C936C` | Draw string [a1] (its length + 2 at +0, the characters from +2) with the letter sprites at x, y: letters and digits, a space 6 pixels, other characters nothing |

| `NewHandle` | `$80999B` | A handle for a block of x bytes (a's bit 14: locked) in bank y ($7E or $7F; any other: either), compacting the heaps when it does not fit at first; 0 when no handle or no room |
| `SetHandleSize` | `$809D8E` | Resize handle a's block to x bytes: in place when it can (shrinking by 9 or more: the rest a free block, joined with a free block after it; growing into a free block after it), else in a new block (NewHandle, either bank, not locked) that the old data (its size + 1 bytes) is moved to, the old one freed and the handle kept |
| `LinearToPlanar` | `$9B85C2` | Convert linear 4bpp tiles at p0 (r0 bytes: r0 / 4 + 1 rows of 8 pixels, one row more than the bytes) to SNES planar into p1 (a 16-bit address in p0's bank): each row's two words, a nibble per pixel (a zero word skips its 4 pixels), into the row's plane words at +0 / +$10 of its tile |
| `Mode7MapToVRAM` | `$808D43` | Copy byte map [p0] (width, height, then the bytes from +6) into the mode 7 map at column x, row y (128 bytes a row), a row at a time: at once with the screen blanked (VMAIN 0, the low bytes), else queued (type $FB) |
| `Mode7MapToVRAM_t1` | `$808DED` | (unused entry) paste r6+2 bytes of [p0] into the map at [p1] (r7 entries a row) at column x, row y as words + a; a 0 byte ends the string, the rest of the count filled with $20 + a |

| `Multi5Init` | `$9B8358` | Check for the multitap, then clear the multitap pads and state |
| `mp5_sig` | (a helper) | Read the five pads: pads 1 and 2 from the auto read, pads 3 to 5 through the multitap on port 2 when mp5present is set (pads 4 and 5 only every 30 frames while nobody uses them); a port line change runs Multi5ConnectCheck for 16 frames; pads without the standard signature read $000F; with a warning every pad flashes $1000 / 0. |
| `Multi5Bios` | `$9B80AB` | The pads' read of each frame, run by the NMI after the frame hook: JoyPad[0-4], with the multitap's check and warnings |

| `Decompress` | `$80C373` | Unpack the data at [p0] to WRAM at [p1] (through the WRAM port, once the DMA queue is empty) by its format word: $FB10 LZ, $FB46 pairs, $FB30 Huffman, $FB7A run-length; the unpacked size from the header (its big-endian word at +3), or 1 for an unknown format |
| `SPCUploadBlock` | `$809906` | SPCUpload of the sample at [p0]: its loop point and length (big-endian words), then the BRR blocks from +4 (the sound locked meanwhile) |
| `NMI` | `$808147` | The NMI vector: NMI_Fast, then NMI_FrameHookReturn unless NMISkip was set when it came |
| `NMI_Fast` | `$80814B` | The NMI: nothing while NMISkip is set (the 16-bit RDNMI read takes TIMEUP too), else the DMA budget for the frame, the NMI hook (NMIHookNext taken when set), then NMI_HookReturn. |
| `nmi_dma` | (a helper) | (a DMA of channel 0 for a queue entry: its source and size from the entry, to VRAM at +6, if the budget left covers cost + its size; 0 when not) |
| `NMI_HookReturn` | `$808186` | The NMI after its hook: the IRQ timers, INIDISP, the six BG scroll registers, the colour DMA left by DMAToCGRAM, then the DMA queue while the frame's budget lasts (entry types: a DMAP value; $FE $FF one or two words written through VMDATA; $FD / $FC low / high byte fills; $FB low bytes; the rest high bytes), then NMI_SendOAM (NMI_Tick when the budget ran out) |
| `NMI_SendOAM` | `$8083A5` | The NMI: the queue head at x; the sprite table to OAM when it is ready and the budget has $26E left; then NMI_Tick |
| `NMI_Tick` | `$8083DD` | The NMI's frame work: vcount (with the 50 Hz fraction's carry), a step of the fade (in after the fadestep delay, out with $FFFF; not on the frames STAT77 bit 7 is set), FrameCount (unless held), then the frame hook (FrameHookNext taken when set) |
| `SetPlayerStatsRange` | `$9C8826` | The first and last row of the player stats list of team a2: its goalies (statcolumn 0), else its skaters (after the goalies); curitem the first |
| `StepTrack` | `$80A86F` | Track t: count its wait down, or play its events until one gives a wait (notes start voices, $D9 and up are commands: $D9/$DA stop the song, $E2/$DB loop (from the pointer the track's events started at), $DD tempo, $DE volume, $DF controllers, $E5 pitch bend (the pitches it sets take the tuning of the entry at InstPtr, whichever it is), $DC program change); returns CurTrack |
| `SequencerTick` | `$80AC4A` | The tempo: TempoAcc + $40, and while it reaches TempoTick (less it each time) a tick: the music voices updated and, unless the music is paused, every track stepped (from the last; none when the song stops, and no more ticks without tracks) |
| `SoundUpdate` | `$80AD9D` | Each frame, unless the sound is locked: the fade (SoundVolume less SoundFadeSpeed, the sound reset below 0, else the volume sent), the sound effect voices and the song's ticks (the pause's mute of the volume is undone at once) |
| `NMI_FrameHookReturn` | `$808469` | The NMI after the frame hook: the pads (Multi5Bios; b the accumulator's high byte the hook leaves), SoundUpdate, the sound stream, NMISkip cleared |
